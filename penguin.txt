-- Penguin -> Nathaniel W. --

I (Cam/expxx) have known Penguin for a little over 4 years now. He's run over 10 different hosts. I think it was his very first, he didn't know anything about Systems Admin, or even setting up a host. He pulled up a youtube video which just happened to be mine. He contacted me on discord, and pulled me into his first host. I've run countless with him over the years, not sure why I did but he asked and I said sure. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every single one of the hosts he's ever run, I've been the one doing most if not all of the work. He's just been paying the bills and reaping the benefits. As I'm unable to receive payment due to personal reasons, all the profits or income of anything has always gone to him. Yes, you read that right. I've done most, if not all, of the work. Penguin's received all of the income. I think the most he's ever done on one of the hosts is setup pterodactyl and ControlPanel.GG, which I had to reinstall anyway due to the poor setup.

I don't blame penguin for taking all the income, I told him I couldn't take any. That's on me for deciding to get into work without the ability to take money. But I do blame penguin for not helping out with anything, that and trying to start a host without any experience in systems administration. Even if he did try to help, he either couldn't figure it out and left it half finished, or just didn't even start it. That, I do blame penguin for.

Anyway, he's gotten ahold of CreateNow now, he purchased it for $1,000 GBP over the period of 4 months. Simply (previous owner) said in the Minehut Partners general chat he was willing to get rid of it at any time, so I offered it to Penguin and he bought it. I came on as an IT worker (Systems Admin), but ended up doing most of all the available work anyway, as I'd done for all of the other ones aswell. Including most business operations, systems administration, maintenance, support tickets, suggestions & improvements, and everything inbetween. The only thing I didn't do is pay the bills.

A ways through this whole ordeal, I decided to quit. So I told penguin I quit and he said ok. I packed up all my things and left, not even 2 days later he asked me to come back because something was broken and he couldn't figure it out. So I came back and fixed it. This happened 2 more times for various reasons before Joey came in. ( ref. https://expx.dev/odyssey.txt ) This held me in for a bit as I finally had someone to help me do things, granted there wasn't much to do, but when there was it got done faster. Then if you continue reading that link, things went south. Right before that I quit again. Once Joey pulled out, penguin immediately came to me and asked me to help. This'd be the 4th time I'd been pulled back in. But I don't like seeing money go to waste, so I came back and helped set it back up, except Penguin refused to even get a server. So I was just there for emotional support..? Regardless I quit a few days later.

I'd love to say that's the end of it, but I literally had to fake my death to even get penguin to listen to me telling him no. This was also the case with another person I wont be naming. Different situation, same concept. I kept getting asked to do something and I said no.

Penguin quite literally CALLED MY DADS PHONE. I'll never forgive him for that. I don't know how he got it, but not only did he get that, he shared other personal information about me with other people I knew, so they could come and ask me about my "death" and quiz me to make sure I'm really me. I don't know, regardless that was a step too far and I'll never forgive him for that.

At that point so many people depended on me because I didn't charge anything because I couldn't. They depended on me because I was free and knew how to do things, so they figured they could just get me to do anything. Which I suppose was the case, I'll admit I'm not the best at saying no to something. If someone continually pressures me into doing something I'll end up doing it, and they won't pay me because I can't take it. I'm getting better at this, but at the time I had to get a mutual friend to tell him no before he would leave me alone. 

That's the end of it, and I hope to god it will be forever. I don't ever want to talk to Nathaniel ever again. At least not personally.

-- Penguin, if you're reading this, and you're selfish enough to DMCA this, you'd be DMCAing RapidHost. Not like I operate that company or anything, not like im obliged to follow a DMCA on first recieve.
