Do not trust OdysseyNodes LLC's Management.

On December 11th, 2023, Nathaniel W. purchased CreateNow. On January 17, 2024, OdysseyNodes LLC integrated it's operations with CreateNow. On March 20, 2024, Joey (owner of OdysseyNodes LLC) opted to step down from CreateNow Ownership if Nathaniel did not remove himself from CreateNow's Managment team. On 03/20/24 Nathaniel accepted the deal and began transferring assets to Joey. Approximately 20 minutes later, after all the assets we're transferred, Joey pulled out of the deal and decided to sever ties with CreateNow, essentially reversing the merge between OdysseyNodes LLC and CreateNow. Immediately after that, all servers were taken offline, and access to everything by CreateNow's Management was revoked, effectively barring the CreateNow Team from accessing Client Records and continuing operations.

A letter was sent to the Management Team of OdysseyNodes LLC requesting CreateNow's client information and server data to be returned, and as of 03/24/24, we have yet to receive the client information, or server data. The CreateNow Management team has given OdysseyNodes LLC 4 days to return the data, if data is not returned within a reasonable time, action will be taken at the Hosting Provider level.

As of 03/24/24, an announcement was posted in OdysseyNodes LLC's discord claiming a member of the CreateNow Management Team, specifically expxx, has breached their client database systems and deleted data irreversibly. As expxx himself, this did not happen. The reason their client database system is broken is because I was doing some work on the Client Database server a bit before the unmerge, and to do so I needed to remove the Port Forwarding for the Proxmox LXC container which was running their databases. Which are runninn on a Proxmox LXC container using Docker Compose to run multiple MariaDB Servers, one for each of the nodes. I'm aware this isn't the best setup, however it was done under the guidance of Cj R, the old Cyber Security Agent. All they need to do to fix the setup, is add the Port Forwarding rule back to their pfSense Router.

As of today (03/24/24), CreateNow and OdysseyNodes LLC are unmerged, and data is being held hostage by OdysseyNodes LLC, which should rightfully belong to CreateNow. They have until 03/26/24 to return the data before we take action at the hosting provider level, and have their servers shut down. Let it be known, we are already in contact with their Hosting Provider, PlasmaRack Solutions LLC, and will at no hesitation, request the servers to be shut down immediately.
